# WIP, not reliable. i may just go for two regular peristaltic pumps instead.
# The idea is to drive a small 5V motor with a gearbox for torque as the pump driver + a single micro servo as the pump "switcher".
# This would allow a multiplexed pump driven from a single motor to drive as many pumps as the servo can select.
# For switching the motor i use a BC337 transistor with a 1K resistor on the base to switch to ground.
# The servo is just directly connected to a GPIO pin.
# short BOM:
# * 2 4mm rails
# * M3 hex key (cut off the 90Â° turn to essentially turn it into a 3mm shaft and chamfer the edge with a file or sanding paper)
# * SG90 microservo
# * N20 5V geared motor (i tested with 60rpm models, i think 120rpm or more could also work)
# assembly
# * The motor gets fixed using the pump driver bottom/top models, then slid onto the rails
# * The pumps get slid onto the rails (arbitrary amount, as many as the drivespline can select)
# * the motor to hex adapter gets connected to the motor shaft, the hex shaft connected to it (use superglue)
# * the drive spline slides onto the hex shaft
# * the servo bracket slides onto the main rails
# * the gear gets connected to the SG90 servo and laid onto the main drive spline.
# * the motor can now actuate the selected pump via drivespline position, the servo can rotate to select a different pump.
