## gimbal

holds a phone using a printed clamp, can rotate in two axes using cheap SG90 servos.

see [printables](../../printables/cameraholder).

## multipump

a multiplexed pump with just a single drive motor + pump selector servo.

i don't have a reliable way to switch the pump yet though, the servo torque seems a bit low and the assembly is a bit difficult to debug/work with.

i may just go for multiple peristaltic pumps for now, but this would allow better scaling to multiple inputs

(i.e. to feed many different liquid fertilizers in precise amounts)
