# camera holder

WIP: remix hodgepodge of 

* other holders in this project
* phone holder for printable tripod https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2221802
* SG90 2 axis gimbal https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2892903

TBD: need to cut th holders down a bit since the collide with the EN16 pipe.

## BOM

* 2 SG90 micro servos
* 1-2 rubber bands (i use one for pulling down the clamp of the phone holder, another one for tensioning the y axis upwards so the servo can handle the weight.)
